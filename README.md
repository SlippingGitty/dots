# Shitty script I grab when I distro hop again

This repo is very specific to me and me only. It comes with a script which links to that Surface Linux Setup script, installs yay, and then installs all the packages I want. There is also a .config folder for i3 which isn't much anything special.

There is two options here

* Arch
* Debian

Arch has more stuff in it cause more often than not I'm using Arch or something that is Arch based. 

I do *not* reccommend you using this. Legit, the only reason this is here. Is. Because. I. Am. Lazy.
