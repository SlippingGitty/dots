# My dot files for when I decide its a good idea to distro hop again

This repo is very specific to me and me only. 

Just for the .sh file: `bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlippingGitty/dots/main/setup.sh)`

## ❓ What is in here? 

There includes my .config files for i3, and my setup.sh file.

## 💬 What's in the .config files?

There includes my i3 configurations, mostly shortcuts and exec stuff. Along with this, there is `i3blocks`, `i3status`, `picom` (for blur), and `volumeicon`. Most of these are useless, since bumblebee-status replaces i3bar, anyways.

# 💻 What's in the .sh file?

There is two options.

* Arch
* Ubuntu

### The Arch dialog option includes the following:

* The Linux-Surface Dialog script
* The installation of yay
* The installation of `i3 cmus steam youtube-dl thunar kdenlive discord-canary picom blueman steam unzip unrar pavucontrol feh curl npm flameshot qbittorrent google-chrome-stable rofi lxappearance thunar tumbler alacritty krita neovim git zsh neofetch`
* The bumblebee-status i3bar "theme" folder being cloned into the .config folder

### The Ubuntu dialog option includes the following:
* The Linux-Surface Dialog script
* The installation of yay
* The installation of `i3 curl npm flameshot qbittorrent firefox rofi lxappearance thunar tumbler picom unrar feh unzip kitty krita neovim git zsh neofetch flatpak kdenlive blueman steam cmus youtube-dl`
* The setup of flatpak
* The bumblebee-status i3bar "theme" folder being cloned into the .config folder
